	<h1 >Soojung Kang: The Korean Designer</h1>

	<h2> Soojung Kang or Crystal, is a graphic design student who comes from Korea. She’s a mother of 2: a girl and a boy. Despite her responsibilities as a mother and a wife, I have never seen her miss a class. Hardworking and talented is the two words I use to describe her. We’ve been friends for two years and I have seen many of her works, most of them are unique and remarkable. She is also very easygoing and nice. When I asked her for an interview, she was gladly to help and I learned many things about her.</h2>
